This file keeps track of major changes applied to the code after the first 
release (version 1.0.0)

==========

  1. Added module "atmosphere.py" including methods for relevant atmospheric calculations such as:
  
    - pressure, number density as function of altitude
    - gravitational constant as a function of latitude and altitude
    - modelling of Rayleigh extinction and atm. refractive index for variable atm. CO2 amounts based on Bodhaine et al., 1999, *On Rayleigh Optical Depth Calculations* and references therein
